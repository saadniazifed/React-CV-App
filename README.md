## Areas for Improvement
1. Thus far has only been formatted to display effectively on a 13" macbook air.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Learning about ReactJS was tough at first due to new concepts of Props and State. But the more I built this project and studied the React Beta Docs, the more it became natural and intuititve for me. Doing this project with Class Based Components and using the keyword `this` in React was a challenge but overcame it quite quickly. Function Based Components made the task much easier as it removed the this keyword from the entire application.
